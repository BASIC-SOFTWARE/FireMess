# FIREBASE VERSION OF CHAT APP
## It is the terminal messenger developed by Peter Repiev
### Here you can chat with whoever you want. Just give your name and go ahead!
#### First of all download all files through *git clone https://github.com/Potriashka/fbv.git* or by pressing "download zip" button
#### To start you need to install all needed Python moduls by printing:
##### Windows
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
#maybe it won't work and you'll need to install all modules in old way
```
##### Linux
```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
#### and then with a short command
##### Windows:
```python
cd fbv
cd specVERS
py firebaseversion.py
```
##### Linux:
```python
cd fbv/
python3 firebaseversion.py
```
#### Notes: 
###### if you're on windows and you're having some problems contact me by https://github.com/Potriashka/fbv/issues 
#### you can launch the Messenger and start chatting
You can print
```python
/clear
```
and all chat history will be deleted.
With
```python
(y), (yes) and (no)
```
you can print üëç or üëé.
